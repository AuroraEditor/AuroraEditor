Aurora Editor is an IDE built by the community, for the community, and written in Swift for the best native performance and feel for macOS. 

It will support everything you could expect from an Xcode-inspired application, including deep integration with your selected Git provider, project planning, and your favourite built in editor tools.

## Motivation

Developers should be able to use an editor that feels snappy and fast.

Most comparable editors are built on Electron, this is a huge disadvantage because it utilizes a lot of unnecessary system resources. Electron requires a Chromium instance to run. This can mean massive performance losses and high RAM usage even for small apps built on it. Additionally, the overall code footprint is much larger and animations are slower. More frames are lost and things like window resizing feel laggy. Native apps are smooth as butter and utilize system resources much more efficiently for better performance and reliability.

Xcode is a great native editor for developers on Mac, but unfortunately it doesn't support creating a multitude of projects in different programming languages, and this is where Aurora Editor comes in. Aurora Editor wants to give developers the possibility of creating their desired projects in their desired language on an editor that is native and gives a similar experience, performance and feel to that of Xcode on Mac.

## Difference between `AuroraEditor` and `CodeEdit`

We have all contributed to CodeEdit, and some of us continue to contribute to the CE community. However, there are several notable distinctions in our approach:

1. We actively encourage the submission of smaller pull requests (PRs), even if they are not flawless. Our rationale is that this approach can expedite the project development.

2. We have adopted a different syntax highlighting engine. Our decision is based on the belief that Tree-sitter's parsing speed may not be sufficient, especially during the initial parsing stages.

3. We have streamlined the project by removing a significant number of modules that frequently encountered fetch failures and required additional instructions for users.

4. Our primary focus lies on functionality rather than aesthetics. While CodeEdit emphasizes creating visually appealing designs, our primary goal is to ensure that the system functions correctly. Design refinements are considered once functionality is achieved.

5. Some of us have experienced situations where our ideas were initially deemed unsuitable. However, it has come to our attention that these ideas were eventually implemented weeks later due to an admin's suggestion.

These are some of the key differences in our approach to CodeEdit, aimed at enhancing project development and efficiency.
