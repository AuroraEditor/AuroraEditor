## Checks, Tests & Documentation

GitHub will inform the required reviewers for you.

Please resolve all `Violation` errors in Xcode. Otherwise the swiftlint check on GitHub will fail.

Once you submit the `PR` GitHub will run a couple of actions which run tests and `SwiftLint` (this can take a couple of minutes). Should a test fail, it cannot be merged until tests succeed.

Make sure to resolve all merge-conflicts otherwise the `PR` cannot be merged.

> **Important**: make sure your code is well documented so others can interact with your code easily!
