/// Class that manages a broadcaster.
/// The broadcaster is a publisher used to broadcast a command to any subscribers of
/// ``broadcaster``. Those subscribers can then act on the information provided.
///
/// To create a subscriber to ``broadcaster``, use the following code,
/// where `cancelables` is an instance of `Set<AnyCancellable>`:
/// ```
/// workspace.broadcaster.broadcaster.broadcaster.sink { command in
///     if command["name"] == "myCommand" {
///         // do something with the command
///     }
/// }
/// .store(in: &cancelables)
/// ```
/// **Remember to cancel the sink on deinit or view dissapear**
/// ```
/// cancelables.forEach({ $0.cancel() })
/// ```
///
/// For example, in a `View`:
/// ```swift
/// @EnvironmentObject var workspace: WorkspaceDocument
/// @State var cancelables: Set<AnyCancellable> = .init()
///
/// var body: some View {
///     VStack { /*your view here*/ }
///     // this code does not need to go on a VStack,
///     // just put it somewhere in your body.
///     // this cannot occur in the init function
///     // as workspace would not exist yet
///     .onAppear {
///         workspace.broadcaster.broadcaster.sink { command in
///             if command.name == "myCommand" {
///                 // do something with the command
///             }
///         }
///         .store(in: &cancelables)
///     }
///     .onDissapear {
///         cancelables.forEach({ $0.cancel() })
///     }
/// ```
